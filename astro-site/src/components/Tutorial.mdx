## Astro Install
For this tutorial, we will be using Astro to simplify the installation of Vue, React, and Svelte.

1. To install astro, open a terminal in any directory and run
```
npm create astro@latest
```
2. Next, specify the location and name you would like to create the project in. If you would like to create the project in the folder you are currently in, just specify the project name. For this tutorial we will be naming the projet `astro-site`

3. After that, astro will ask you which template you would like to use. Templates provide the developer with a starting ground of files to make it easier for them to get started. For this tutorial, we will be selecting `Empty Project` for the template, so that we avoid having to remove any unecessary files.

Using your arrow keys, navigate down to `Empty Project`, then press the enter key to select it.

After selecting the project, astro will start copying the project files. 
4. When astro is done copying the project files, astro will ask if you would like to install npm dependencies. Press `y` to install them

5. Press `n` to avoid initializing a git repository

6. Since this is a beginner tutorial, we will select `I prefer not to use TypeScript` for the TypeScript option. TypeScript is a subset of JavaScript, it basically adds type safety to JavaScript so that you catch common type errors at compile time instead of runtime. It is usually more useful when there is a large project with teams of developers.

Using your arrow keys, navigate down to `I prefer not to use TypeScript`, then press the enter key to select it.

Upon successful installation, you'll see `Ready for liftoff!` in green, and a series of instructions to start the development server:

## Astro Setup
1. Open a terminal in the `./astro-site` directory, then install vue, react, and svelte dependencies with the following commands, pressing y on any prompts to install dependencies or change the config file.
```
npx astro add react
npx astro add vue
npx astro add svelt
```
![react install](/react-install.png)
![vue install](/vue-install.png)
![svelte install](/svelte-install.png)
Astro will automatically install the dependencies and will change the configuration files for you.
## Page Setup
Astro uses what is called `file-based routing`, which means that each file in the `/pages` directory corresponds to a path in the browser. By default, `index.astro` will correspond to the `/` path.

1. First, go back to the pages directory and create a folder for each framework component:
```
cd src/pages
mkdir react
mkdir vue
mkdir svelte
```
2. Inside each folder, create a file called `index.astro`. 

Whenever you navigate to folder, it will route to the index of that folder. For example, going to `/react` will cause astro to render what is inside `/pages/react/index.astro`
```
New-item react/index.astro
New-item vue/index.astro
New-item svelte/index.astro
```
3. In addition to `index.astro`, we will need to create each framework file in their respective directories:
```
New-item react/react-demo.jsx
New-item vue/vue-demo.vue
New-item svelte/svelte-demo.svelte
```

4. In each framework `.astro` file, you will need to import the framework component and render it to the screen. 

The `client:load` is called a *directive*, and basically just tells astro to load the javascript as soon as it is rendered to the client.

`/pages/react/index.astro`
```astro
---
import ReactDemo from './react-demo';
---
<a href="/demo">Back to /demo</a>
<ReactDemo client:load />
```

`/pages/vue/index.astro`
```astro
---
import Vue from './vue-demo.vue'
---
<a href="/demo">Back to /demo</a>
<Vue client:load />
```
`pages/svelte/index.astro`
```astro
---
import SvelteDemo from './svelte-demo.svelte'
---
<a href="/demo">Back to /demo</a>
<SvelteDemo client:load />
```

5. To complete the page setup, paste the following into `/pages/index.astro` to enable navigation between the different framework components.
```astro
---
---
<a href="/">Back to home</a>
<h1>Index of demo!</h1>
<a href="/demo/react">React Demo</a> | 
<a href="/demo/svelte">Svelte Demo</a> | 
<a href="/demo/vue">Vue Demo</a>
```
