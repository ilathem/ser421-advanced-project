## The Dark Ages Before Client-Side Frameworks  

Back in the early days of the internet, most of the content on the web was document driven. Internet 
Explorer and Netscape Navigator were the two browsers out there, fighting to be number one. Netscape knew that
in order to be able to compete with Microsoft it needed something of an edge so they ask Brendan Eich to create a programming language
for them to use in the browser. JavaScript was developed by him in only 10 days. It was originally called Mocha but the name quickly changed to Livescript
and finally, JavaScript. The name change was assumed to have been brought about by the popularity of the Java programming language in 1995 and Netscape looking
to fool people into relating the two languages, although they have very little in common except for the first four letters of their name.  
  


The popularity of Navigator peaked in 1996 after the release of the Javscript to almost 80% of the usage share but by the end of 2000 that
number would drop to less than 20%. Internet Explorer came out on top here but there were other browsers emerging. The content on these browsers
were server-side driven, which meant that everything that happened in the browser would come from the server and the content viewed by the user would not update 
without some sort of refresh. Web developers saw a need for something different that would create a better user experience. This led to the development of the 
first client-side frameworks during the early to late 2000s starting with Dojo.
