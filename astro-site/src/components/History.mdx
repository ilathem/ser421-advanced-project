## History of Client-Side Frameworks

## The Dark Ages Before Client-Side Frameworks  

Back in the early days of the internet, most of the content on the web was document driven. This means that back then, when you would go to a web page whatever they
sent when you went there was what you would see in your browser. Nothing would change until you clicked something else on the page (usually another hyperlink) or 
refreshed that page.In those early days, Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator were the two dominant browsers out there, fighting to be number one. Netscape knew that
in order to be able to compete with Microsoft it needed something of an edge so they asked Brendan Eich to create a programming language
for them to use in the browser. JavaScript was developed by him in only 10 days. It was originally called Mocha but the name quickly changed to Livescript
and finally, JavaScript. The name change was assumed to have been brought about by the popularity of the Java programming language in 1995 and Netscape looking
to fool people into relating the two languages, although they have very little in common except for the first four letters of their name.  
  


The popularity of Navigator peaked in 1996 after the release of the Javscript to almost 80% of the usage share but by the end of 2000 that
number would drop to less than 20%. Internet Explorer came out on top here but there were other browsers emerging. The content on these browsers
were still server-side driven, but Javascript, along with CSS, did make web pages look a little better. Although ther were a variety of server-side Web developers however saw a need for something different that 
would create a better user experience. This led to the development of the first client-side frameworks during the early to late 2000s starting with Dojo.

## And so it begins..

After Dojo, many more client-side frameworks emerged from 2005-2010. Many of these frameworks changed the way the internet was accessed by users. Now user-interaction
can begin to happen on the client-side of the browser. A lot of this was through the manipulation of what is called the DOM, which is short for document object model.
The DOM, which was created in the late 1990s, is an interface that created a tree-like structure of elements out of the HTML that came from the server. The new 
client-side frameworks alowed manipulation of these elements in the browser without having to reload or refresh the page from the server. In 2006, JQuery was released and it quickly became very popular given the new features it introduced. Abstraction between components had traditionally been an issue that made it difficult to program web pages and particularly difficult to create large web pages involving extended functionality. JQuery simplified the process for manipulating the DOM, making web sites easier to program and the necessary code less verbose. Around 2010, the earliest Javascript frameworks, including Angularjs and Knockout, began to be released. More frameworks would follow, including Vue in 2014 and Svelte in 2016. Each of these frameworks attempted to solve well-known problems in web development and to make it progressively easier to develop large scale web applications with smaller investment. There are now many tens of Javascript frameworks available to developers, with Angular, React and Vue being among the most popular.
